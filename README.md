# PyTsetlinMachineCUDA - A Massively Parallel and Asynchronous Architecture for Logic-based AI 

Each logical clause runs in its own thread and accesses the training examples one at a time,  updating itself and a local voting tally in the process. A team of Tsetlin Automata, which can also run in parallel with dedicated hardware, composes the clause.  The Tsetlin Automata thus drive the entire learning process. These are rewarded/penalized according to three local rules that optimize global behaviour (see https://github.com/cair/TsetlinMachine). There is no synchronization among the clause threads, apart from atomic adds to the local voting tallies. Hence, the speed up! The architecture currently supports clause weighting, classification, regression and convolution (support for local and global interpretability, Boolean embedding and multiple layers coming soon).
